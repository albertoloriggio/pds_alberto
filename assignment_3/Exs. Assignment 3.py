'''1. Create a Course class, where each course has a name, a description and a list of enrolled students. You'll need to implement the next methods:
Add a student to the course.
Remove a student from the course.
Show all students in the course.'''

'''2. Create a Student class, where each student has a name, ID number, address and a list of enrolled courses with the following methods:
Enroll in a course.
Drop a course.
Show all registered student courses.'''

'''3. Create a central class that manages courses and students, Registration class, where you have a list of students and a list of courses, and methods:
